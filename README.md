# tetris
Game of Tetris written in C++ with ncurses, can be run in pure Linux terminal.

# How to play?
WSAD to move and Space to drop. I think you know how to play it ;)

# Any new idea?
Maybe not. You can run it in any terminal supporing ncurses.

# Licence
Oh really? A licence for a every-one-knows-it classic game? It's really funny.

# Why it's not that funny and looks....trivial?
Yes, because I'm lazy and I don't think there'll be any people interested in it
so I just wrote it to please myself.

If you like it and want more features but you are lazy to write a new one or
modify my shitty code, please let me know.
